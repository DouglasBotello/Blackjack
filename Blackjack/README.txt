Inlucded in this package is a copy of of blackjack project
taken from eclipse, as well as a runnable .jar file of the
project, and this readme.

In order to run the .jar file, you must open the command line/
terminal to the same directory as the .jar file. Then, insert
the following command: java -jar ConsoleBlackJack.jar

The program is run entirely in the command line/terminal.

The .java files that I created can be found in BlackJack < src 
< blackjack, and the main method resides in GameHandler.java

This program was created by Douglas Botello
